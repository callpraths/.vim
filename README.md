.vim
====
This is my vim configuration.

It uses vundle to manage vim plugins.
The vundle plugin is included in this repo to allow bootstrapping. 
I will periodically update vundle checked into this repo to guard against vundle
updates from breaking the vundle update process.

Otherwise, use vundle to install and update all plugins (including vundle
itself):

To install:
  :BundleInstall
To update
  :BundleInstall!
